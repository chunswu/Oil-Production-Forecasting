# Oil Production Forecasting

## Background and Motivation

Every operator in the Oil and Gas industry spends millions of dollars and time to create the best performing wells. From my experience working in the industry I believe they're multiple parameters that would influece oil production, the goal of the project is to predict the produciton of oil wells at 180 days (State manditory report). Proppant (sand) also influences production results; however, it is the fluid design that would carry the proppant to the formation and influence fracture geometry.
